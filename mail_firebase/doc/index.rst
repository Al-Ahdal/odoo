      If in your conf not have databaseURL param
      The databaseURL property is for the Firebase Realtime Database, which you probably didn't create yet. The databaseURL property is not necessary to use Firestore though, so you should be able to access that with just the configuration data you have. In fact, for Firestore all you should need is the projectId property.
